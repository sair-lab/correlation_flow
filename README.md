This repo contains source codes for the following paper, which is accepted by ICRA-18:

[Chen Wang](https://wang-chen.github.io) *, Tete Ji *, Thien-Minh Nguyen, and [Lihua Xie](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/elhxie/), "Correlation Flow: Robust Optical Flow Using Kernel Cross-Correlators", IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2018.

# Platform
  Codes have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS kinetic.
  
# Install Dependencies:
  1. Install FFT library: 
	```
	sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc
	```

# Install Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL):

	MKL is optional but highly recommended for computational efficiency. It improves the running speed a lot.

  1. Download MKL from Intel website
  2. Extract downloaded file 
  	```
  	tar -zxvf [name_of_downloaded_file]
  	```
  3. Go to extracted folder, give permission: 
  	```
  	sudo chmod +x install.sh
  	```
  4. Run installation 
	```
  	./install.sh
  	```
  5. Link library, add to .bashrc: 
  	```
  	source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
  	```
  6. Try compile in ROS workspace
